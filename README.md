# E-Ink messaging

This small device is composed of a raspberry Pi and a E-ink display. 
It runs a python script that fetches the last mail sent to a it's own gmail adress and displays the message from the email onto the display.

It can display in the text in:

2. Red
3. Red with black shadow

It takes input from the messages in the mail if it sees a special flag (example: "Text:RED", will force the text to be displayed only red).
